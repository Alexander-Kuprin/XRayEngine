### More details
This repository contains XRay Engine 1.6 sources based on T-6638

It is a place to share ideas on what to implement, gather people that want to work on the engine,
and work on the source code.

If you find a bug or have an enhancement request, file an [Issue](https://github.com/TheBearProject/XRayEngine/issues).

Pull requests appreciated! However, the following things should be taken into consideration:
* We want to keep the game as close as possible to the vanilla game, so instead of introducing new gameplay features,
  consider adding non-gameplay features, fixing bugs, improving performance and code quality
* Major changes should be discussed before implementation

Be advised that this project is not sanctioned by GSC Game World in any way â€“ and they remain the copyright holders
of all the original source code.
